# :heavy_exclamation_mark::heavy_exclamation_mark:DISCLAIMER 
**PROJECT STATUS:** We still need validation with health regulatory institutions and compliance with clinical requirements. - The tests on Lung Simulators are Sucessfull, limited on application depending on hardware availability but viable on emergency cases

**PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS MACHINE IF NOT NEEDED**, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE OPERATION OF THIS MACHINE | THIS MACHINE IS FOR EMERGENCY and HEALTH SYSTEM COLLAPSE SCENARIOS :warning: 

# Main Goal

Design, Build, Validate a reliable Ventilation Medical Equipment Project for people, regions, countries in difficult economical situations with a component-agnostic philosophy. This is why we didn't continue putting efforts into the projects being developed by other teams, who have a different society and economic reality.

**The equipment must have as few industrial parts as possible. If necessary, parts must be easily accessible, even in small towns and villages.**

## Technical highlights

OpenVentilator has adjustable PEEP and maximum pressure threshold, with a wide range. It has adjustable timing for the inspiratory and expiratory phases, allowing a wide range of BPM and I/E. The volume per breath is adjustable mechanically.

This initiative as other projects was born on the [Open Source COVID19 Medical Supplies](https://web.facebook.com/groups/opensourcecovid19medicalsupplies/) Facebook Group by the awareness of the need to create a Ventilator solution for the scarcity plaguing our society worldwide. I contacted Jeremias Almada from Argentina who by that time had presented an Ambu solution and a Cad Design. The idea was interesting but needed improvements.

Since then we tried to establish some development and community standards and evolved the project several times.
